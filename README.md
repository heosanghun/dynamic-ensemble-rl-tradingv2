## Overview

This system implements a four-layer hierarchical architecture that adapts to market regime changes through real-time regime classification and performance-based dynamic weight allocation. The framework consists of specialized agent pools for different market conditions (Bull, Bear, Sideways) and uses ensemble learning to aggregate their decisions.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main layers:

1. Multimodal Feature Fusion Layer: Combines candlestick chart images (CNN), technical indicators, and news sentiment into a unified state vector.

2. Market Regime Classification Layer: Uses XGBoost to classify the market into Bull, Bear, or Sideways regimes with confidence-based selection mechanism.

3. PPO Reinforcement Learning Layer: Three separate pools of 5 PPO agents each, specialized for different market regimes with regime-specific reward functions.

4. Ensemble Decision Layer: Aggregates policies from active agent pool using dynamic weighting based on rolling 30-day Sharpe Ratio.

## Key Features

- Real-time market regime classification with confidence threshold (theta = 0.6)
- Regime-specific reward functions for optimal behavior in each market condition
- Dynamic ensemble weighting using Softmax with temperature (T = 10)
- Walk-Forward Expanding Window Cross-Validation for robust evaluation
- Comprehensive backtesting with transaction costs (0.05% fee, 0.02% slippage)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PyTorch
- Stable Baselines3 (or custom PPO implementation)
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- TA-Lib (for technical indicators)
- Gymnasium (or Gym)
- Matplotlib, Plotly (for visualization)

## Usage

### Quick Start (Component Testing)
```bash
python scripts/quick_start.py
```
This script tests basic components with synthetic data without requiring full data setup.

### Training

Train regime classifier:
```bash
python scripts/train.py --component regime --config config/config.yaml
```

Train PPO agents:
```bash
python scripts/train.py --component agents --config config/config.yaml
```

### Main Trading Execution
```bash
python scripts/main.py
```
This executes Algorithm 1 from the paper, running the complete trading loop.

### Evaluation
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --config config/config.yaml
```

### Example Usage
```bash
python scripts/example_usage.py
```
See example_usage.py for detailed usage examples of individual components.
